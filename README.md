## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths: 
#### I made this project to use personally and share it with loved ones that I know are struggling with mental health. Motivating me to make this a great project. By Starting off with the most difficult part I will make sure that my time is properly balanced and I left CSS for last since it is the most enjoyable and easier things for me to work with.

### Weaknesses:
#### I tend to struggle with certain parts of React such as rendering new data and figuring out how to combine a button with a count function. I will use previous labs and homeworks for reference to this.

### Opportunities:
#### This project will help me better my learned skills, and strengthen my current weaknesses.

### Threats:
#### I have a hard time asking for help when I get stuck, however with this project I will make sure to reach out to the instructors when I need assistance so this can be the best project possible.
